#   These settings control the operation of the tircd program, telling it     #
#   which addresses to listen on, and where to store it's settings and logs.  #
#                                                                             #

# This controls what address / port the server listens on
# Comment out the address line to listen on all interface
address 127.0.0.1
port 6667

# This controls whether tircd accesses Twitter via SSL.
# This is highly recommended for privacy/security considerations
# However it is disabled by default, as configuring it can take some
# effort
#
# In order to verify the SSL certs, one of 4 things needs to be set Correctly:
# 1) The https_ca_dir setting is the path to an un-packed CA Root certificate bundle.
# 2) The HTTPS_CA_DIR environvent variable is the path to an un-packed CA Root certificate bundle.
# 3) The https_ca_file setting is the path to a PEM encoded CA Root certificate archive
# 4) The HTTPS_CA_FILE environment variable is the path to a PEM encoded CA Root certificate archive
use_ssl 0
#https_ca_dir /usr/share/ca-certificates/
#https_ca_file  /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.crt

# This controls where tircd will store it's configuration data
# This is used to store per-user preferences and channel lineups
# If not set, data will not be saved between user sessions
storage_path /tmp/tircd

# This controls how POE logs data
# Current options for logtype are 'stdout', 'stderr', 'file', or 'none', 
# If file is chosen logfile must be set to a path for the log file
logtype stdout
logfile tircd.log

# This option turns on lots of extra debugging.  The default setting is 0 or off.

#   These settings set the DEFAULT vaules for user settings such as delay     #
#   between timeline updates, automatically shortening URLs, how to handle    #
#   messages longer than 140 characters, etc.                                 #

#   User settings can be viewed by typing '/stats m' when connected. To       #
#   change a setting, use '/stats <setting name> <new value>'                 #

# auto_post controls whether any text entered into the #twitter channel is posted
# as a new tweet. Setting to 0 safeguards against posting information accidentally
# 
# Text that begins with ! is not posted to twitter regardless of this setting, 
# it is handled as a tircdbot command.
auto_post 1

# display_ticker_slots controls whether tircd displays a slot-id prior to every tweet it outputs.
# This slot-id is the for selecting a tweet for retweeting or replying-to.
display_ticker_slots 1

# store_access_tokens controls whether tircd saves twitter OAuth access tokens in between tircd logins.
# By default tircd stores access tokens. This allows tircd to access twitter the next time you reconnect.
# If you are running a public tircd server or are concerned about who has access to your storage_path directory
# set this setting to 0. Tokens will not be saved, and you will have to login each time you connect to tircd.
store_access_tokens 1

# This controls how often we check with twitter for updates (in seconds)
# Currently The twitter API enforces a limit of 350 api calls per hour
# Updating the timeline takes 2 calls, while direct messages takes 1  
# It's a good idea to ensure your settings don't cause tircd to make more calls than that our you'll get errors
# The default settings will cause ~ 90 calls per hour
update_timeline 120
update_directs 120

# This controls how many updates we'll ask from twitter at a time.  Valid values are 1 to 200.  The default is 50
timeline_count 50

# This controls how we handle tweets longer than 140 characters. There are three options
# ignore - tircd will not do any checking and just pass what is entered to twitter.  Twitter will automatically cut off messages longer than 140 chars.
# warn   - tircd will warn you that the message was too long, and it will not be sent.
# split  - tircd will split your message into multiple tweets.  The min_length and max_splits settings below control splits
long_messages warn

# The min_length setting is the minimum length a split message has to be to send.  
# This keeps tircd from sending a 1 character tweet if you had entered 141 characters.
min_length 20

# The max_splits setting limits the maximum number of tweets sent for one message. 
# If the message splits into more parts than allowed, nothing is sent.
max_splits 5

# join_silent controls how tircd behaves when you join #twitter. 
# 0 - This is the default behaivor, when joining #twitter, you will receive messages since the 
# last time tircd recieved an update for your account. If the amount of tweets is greater than 
# "timeline_count", only that many messages will be retrieved, inclusive of most recent.
# 1 - tircd will be silent when joining the channel, and only show new messages / dms as they come in.
join_silent 0

# Until 0.9 tircd would filter out messages sent by you from other clients, so only traffic sent from irc would show up.
# You can now set this as an option, if you want to see your update from other clients, set this to 0.  1 is the default and previous behaivor.
# Note: this can cause duplicate messages to show, as timeline updates can be delayed coming back from twitter.
filter_self 1

# tircd will use the tinyurl api to automatically shorten URLs in your tweets if this is set to one.
# You must also have the URI::Find module installed so tircd can extract the URLs from your message
shorten_urls 1

# If set tircd will convert <username>: <msg> replies into @<username> <msg> replies so you can use your irc client's tab complettion to send twitter apis
# Currently '<username>: ' must be at the start of the message, and the user must be in the channel for this to work.
convert_irc_replies 0

# Tweets coming from the twitter API by default have their urls changes to t.co urls "for safety" 
# Use expand_urls to have the urls replaced with their un-shortened counterparts before being displayed
expand_urls 1

# If you would like users realnames to appear next to their twitter username when they are @mentioned, use expand_usernames
show_realname 0
